                <h1>What is Newsquid?</h1>

<p>Newsquid is a micro payment gateway specifically designed to make micro-payments easy and cost-effective which makes it possible for readers to access otherwise locked digital content, such as individual articles, blogs and reviews, without having to worry about monthly subscription fees and login information on various websites.</p>


<p>Studies have shown that only 4% of readers are willing to pay for a subscription. So what about the other 96%? Can you as publisher generate income from this large group? With Newsquid you can. Newsquid has several advantages compared to monthly subscriptions and paywalls:</p>


<p>First, Newsquid gives readers the opportunity to read articles at a low price giving publishers the chance to generate income from readers that normally move on without signing up for an subscription.</p>


<p>Secondly, Newsquid makes it possible for publishers to analyse what the readers are interested in paying for, making it easier to create popular content. In other words you can learn your readers' preferences as Newsquid enhances user data.</p>


<p>Lastly Newsquid can be used either on its own or with an already existing paywall making it possible for you to maximize income form your site.</p>
