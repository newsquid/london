                <h1>FAQ</h1>
<strong>DOES A MICRO PAYMENT SERVICE MAKE SENSE FOR ME AND MY SITE?</strong>

<p>A micro payment service like Newsquid can be used in the same way as a normal subscription service where you give your visitors access to all content on your site at a fixed price but in addition or as a supplement to that, Newsquid gives you the opportunity to charge for individual articles and differentiate on the price of each articles.</p>

<strong>IS THERE ANY LONG-TERM COMMITTMENT?</strong>

<p>No. You can stop at any time. You can simply choose to take the Newsquid code off your site.</p>

<strong>DOES NEWSQUID HAVE A WORDPRESS PLUGIN?</strong>

<p>No. We are working on it but at the moment it is not available.</p>

<strong>ARE THERE ANY UPFRONT COSTS?</strong>

<p>No. It is important to us that we don't make any money unless you do. Our pay is a percentage of your total revenue.</p>

<strong>WHAT DOES NEWSQUID CHARGE FOR USING THE SERVICE?</strong>

<p>Newsquid charges 20% of the revenue generated which means you are entitled to 80 % of every successful payment. The  20 % covers transactions costs, including gateway charges and acquirer bank charges, as well as our handling fee.</p>


<strong>CAN I TRY NEWSQUID OUT ON AS LITTLE AS ONE WEB PAGE?</strong>

<p>Yes. Newsquid can be used to lock content even if its just one page.</p>


<strong>HOW DO I GET STARTED?</strong>

<p>We are working on different plugins but at the moment you can only get access though our API. If you contact us we will help you setup Newsquid.</p>


<strong>WHEN AND HOW WILL I BE PAID?</strong>

<p>Every time a reader purchases your digital content, the purchase price is added to the reader’s Newsquid account. While your digital content is made available to the reader instantaneously, the purchase price will not be captured before the total aggregated value of all purchases made by reader using Newsquid reaches or exceeds USD 3, or before the expiry of a 60 day window, whichever comes first.</p>


<strong>DO YOU HANDLE CUSTOMER SERVICE?</strong>

<p>Yes, we will take care of all customer service regarding Newsquid accounts for you. An experienced customer service representative who is knowledgeable about your site and content will be available to answer all customer questions.</p>


<strong>WHAT ARE THE CUSTOMER SERVICE HOURS?</strong>

<p>Monday through Friday, 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. CET, for both publisher and reader support.</p>


<strong>DOES NEWSQUID HANDLE ALL CREDIT CARD SECURITY COMPLIANCE?</strong>

<p>Yes. We take care of all security compliance requirements such as PCI DSS and Financial Privacy Act.</p>


<strong>WHAT NAME WILL APPEAR ON A CUSTOMER'S CREDIT CARD STATEMENT—newsquid OR THE NAME OF MY SITE?</strong>

<p>Hence forward Media which is the company behind Newsquid will appear on the customer’s credit card because the subscriber must know whom to contact with questions.</p>


<strong>DOES NEWSQUID HAVE ANY OWNERSHIP OF MY CONTENT?</strong>

<p>No. We are a payment gateway. You own your content and you choose what to charge. We simply follow the terms you have set.</p>


<strong>ARE ALL MAJOR CREDIT CARDS ACCEPTED?</strong>

<p>Yes.</p>


<strong>IS THERE ANY SYSTEM, CMS OR HOSTING SERVICE IN WHICH NEWSQUID DOESN'T WORK?</strong>

<p>No not that we know of. Newsquid is implemented as a REST API, so any system should work.</p>

<p>If you forgot your password, you are able to retrieve it by clicking on the “forgot password” link on Newsquid.com. You can enter the email that is associated with the account and an email will be sent containing your username and password. Please make sure to check both your inbox and spam folder for the new password.</p>


<strong>HOW DO I CHANGE MY PASSWORD?</strong>

There will be a drop down and click on “change password.” You will be prompted to enter your old password, new password and confirm your new password. Finally, click “Submit” and you are able to log in with your new password.</p>
