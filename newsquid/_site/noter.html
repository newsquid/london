<p class="p3"><b>What is Newsquid?</b></p>
<p class="p5">Newsquid is a micro <i>payment gateway </i>specifically designed to make micro-payments easy and cost-effective which makes it possible for readers to access otherwise locked digital content, such as individual articles, blogs and reviews, without having to worry about monthly subscription fees and login information on various websites.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p5">Studies have shown that only 4% of readers are willing to pay for a subscription. So what about the other 96%? Can you as publisher generate income from this large group? With Newsquid you can. Newsquid has several advantages compared to monthly subscriptions and paywalls:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p5">First, Newsquid gives readers the opportunity to read articles at a low price giving publishers the chance to generate income from readers that normally move on without signing up for an subscription.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p5">Secondly, Newsquid makes it possible for publishers to analyse what the readers are interested in paying for, making it easier to create popular content. In other words you can learn your readers’ preferences as Newsquid enhances user data.</p>
<p class="p6"><br></p>
<p class="p5">Lastly Newsquid can be used either on its own or with an already existing paywall making it possible for you to maximize income form your site.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p7"><br></p>
<p class="p8"><br></p>
<p class="p3"><b>How does it work?</b></p>
<p class="p5">With Newsquid, you select which pages or directories to make pay-only and which to leave free and how much you want to charge for the individual pages. Newsquid does the rest. We collect payments, handle fraud protection and security compliance, even manage subscriber support all done via the Newsquid API. Please contact us to learn about Newsquid micro payment service and we will help you setup the service.</p>

<p class="p3"><b>FAQ:</b></p>
<p class="p4"><b></b><br></p>
<p class="p9"><b>DOes a micro payment service MAKE SENSE FOR Me and my SITE?</b></p>
<p class="p10">Many online publishers believe they must choose between a paywall or subscription model. But a better solution might be a micro payment service where you can charge for individual content/articles and differentiate on the price of each articles. Newsquid can also be an ad-on to your existing paywall or subscription with the same features as described above.</p>
<p class="p11"><br></p>
<p class="p9"><b>IS THERE ANY LONG-TERM COMMITTMENT?</b></p>
<p class="p10">No. You can stop at any time. You can simply choose to take the Newsquid code off your site as easily as you put it on.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11"><br></p>
<p class="p9"><b>DOES Newsquid HAVE A WORDPRESS PLUGIN?</b></p>
<p class="p10">No. We are working on it but at the moment it is not available.</p>
<p class="p11"><br></p>
<p class="p9"><b>ARE THERE ANY UPFRONT COSTS?</b></p>
<p class="p9">No. It is important to us that we don't make any money unless you do. Our pay is a percentage of your total revenue.</p>
<p class="p8"><br></p>
<p class="p9"><b>WHAT DOES newsquid charge for using the service?</b></p>
<p class="p10">Newsquid charges 20% of the income generated so you are entitled to 80 % of every successful payment capture excluding the special USD 0.25 fee (USD 0.50 if American Express), if imposed. The remaining 20 % shall cover transactions costs, including gateway charges and acquirer bank charges, as well as our handling fee.</p>
<p class="p11"><br></p>
<p class="p9"><b>CAN I TRY newsquid OUT ON AS LITTLE AS ONE WEB PAGE?</b></p>
<p class="p10">Yes. Our model lets you decide which content is free and which is paid and how much to charge for access on any particular page—even if its just one page.</p>
<p class="p11"><br></p>
<p class="p9"><b>HOW DO I GET STARTED?</b></p>
<p class="p10">We are working on different plugins but at the moment you can only get access though our API. If you contact us we will help you setup Newsquid.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p11"><br></p>
<p class="p9"><b>WHEN AND HOW WILL I BE PAID?</b></p>
<p class="p12">Every time a reader purchases your digital content, the purchase price is added to the reader’s Newsquid account. While your digital content shall be made available to the reader instantaneously, the purchase price will not be captured before the total aggregated value of all purchases made by reader using Newsquid reaches or exceeds USD 3, or before the expiry of a 60 day window, whichever comes first.</p>

<p class="p11"><br></p>
<p class="p9"><b>DOES Newsquid HANDLE ALL CREDIT CARD SECURITY COMPLIANCE?</b></p>
<p class="p10">Yes. We take care of all security compliance requirements such as PCI DSS and Financial Privacy Act.</p>
<p class="p11"><br></p>
<p class="p9"><b>WHAT NAME WILL APPEAR ON A CUSTOMER'S CREDIT CARD STATEMENT—newsquid OR THE NAME OF MY SITE?</b></p>

<p class="p10">- As part of our service we handle all customer issues regarding payments for you so the subscriber must know whom to contact with questions. <br>

<p class="p11"><br></p>
<p class="p9"><b>Does Newsquid HAVE ANY OWNERSHIP OF MY CONTENT?</b></p>

<p class="p11"><br></p>
<p class="p9"><b>ARE ALL MAJOR CREDIT CARDS ACCEPTED?</b></p>
<p class="p10">Yes.</p>
<p class="p11"><br></p>
<p class="p9"><b>IN TERMS OF SEO, WILL Newsquid AFFECT GOOGLE ABILITY TO SPIDER MY PAGES AND IMPACT RANKING?</b></p>
<p class="p10">No. The pay per article prompt will simply be laid over your content so it is still readable by search engines.</p>
<p class="p11"><br></p>
<p class="p9"><b>IS THERE ANY SYSTEM, CMS OR HOSTING SERVICE IN WHICH Newsquid DOESN'T WORK?</b></p>
<p class="p10">Currently if you are being hosted by Wordpress, our subscription code will not work. This does NOT mean that if you are using Wordpress as your CRM our service won't work. It will. Only if you are a smaller blog actually hosted by Wordpress will our service not work (I.e. your domain name probably looks something like <a href="http://yoursitename.wordpress.com"><span class="s2">http://yoursitename.wordpress.com</span></a></p>
<p class="p11"><br></p>
<p class="p9"><b>HOW DO I RETRIEVE MY PASSWORD?</b></p>
